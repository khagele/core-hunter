// app/ and web/ carry duplicate copies of the locate maths (web/locate.js,
// app/src/geometry.js) and of names.js. #238 asked whether to extract them
// into one shared module; the answer (2026-08-15) is no — neither deploy path
// can ship a file outside its own directory, since the app image builds with
// `app/` as its Docker context and the website deploys as a flat file list.
// So the copies stay, and these assertions are what makes a silent drift
// impossible instead of merely unlikely. Since #538 the app copy is a strict
// subset: locate() itself and toLocatePoints live only on the map, where
// Locate stayed; the shared maths below is still pinned function-for-function.
//
// A parity suite is only worth what its fixtures reach. The first version of
// this file passed 9 of 10 deliberate one-constant drifts, because every
// tunable was masked: the outlier threshold was floor-dominated, the dedupe
// cell was only exercised by exactly-coincident points, and the id set had no
// value at either regex boundary. Every fixture below is chosen so that one
// constant is load-bearing — if you add a case, make it fail for a reason.

// two different things:

//   1. the two stylesheets agree — the drift guard #238 left unbuilt for CSS
//   2. the geometry is *derived*, not restated — a literal `height: 260px`
//      would satisfy (1) and still rot the moment the row height changes
//
// and the last one closes the loop the variable exists for: the JS copies read
// the same number the CSS ships.
