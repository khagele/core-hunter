// panel is wide enough to reach the boxes but the window is not narrow enough
// to trip the old fixed-width fallback, so all three sat behind it with their
// text clipped mid-sentence — a band neither e2e viewport covered.

// placed straight over the bar's second row — including #auth-btn, the target
// the third callout points at. The tour hid the controls it was explaining, and

// was there. #bar as a whole rather than each control: it is full-width and

// it has depends on the viewport and on content that arrives after load.
