# core-hunter PWA — mobile hunter app

A progressive web app that scans a MeshCore mesh via BLE and plots every
directly-heard reception on a live thermal map so you can drive or walk
toward a target node.

## What it is

core-hunter is the mobile **hunter** side of the core-hunter system. The
phone pairs over BLE to a companion MeshCore radio, captures every packet
the radio hears directly (zero-hop, with SNR, RSSI, and the phone's own GPS
fix), and renders them as a heat-map where **hot = strong = close**. Drive
toward the heat to home in on the target.

Receptions are stored locally in IndexedDB and published to an MQTT broker
so the server-side Go ingestor (`server/`) can aggregate observations from
multiple hunters in the field.

## Status

Phase A + B built; iteration-2 capture/visualization changes implemented
(zero-hop only, RSSI metric, ignore-list, multi-resolver). Pending field
verification with hardware and deploy of the ingestor.

## Build and run

```
npm install
```

**Dev server** (Vite — serves on `http://localhost:5173` by default):

```
npm run dev
```

Web Bluetooth and Geolocation both require a [secure context][secure]. The
dev server on `localhost` qualifies; any other host must be served over
HTTPS.

**Production build / preview:**

```
npm run build     # output in dist/
npm run preview   # serve the dist/ build locally
```

**Unit tests** (Vitest, no browser required):

```
npm run test
# or: npx vitest run
```

## Configuration

Copy the example config and fill in your broker details before running:

```
cp public/config.example.json public/config.json
```

`public/config.json` fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mqttUrl` | yes, unless `brokers` has an entry | WSS URL of your EMQX broker, e.g. `wss://broker.example.com:8084/mqtt` |
| `mqttUsername` | yes | Publish-only EMQX account username |
| `mqttPassword` | yes | Publish-only EMQX account password |
| `brokers` | no | More brokers every reception also goes to: an array of `{ id, name, url, username, password }`, or `{ id, name, url, auth: "companion" }` for a broker that takes a token signed by the companion's own key instead of a password. Add `format: "wardrive"` (and optionally `label`, default `hunter`) for a broker that reads receptions as `wardriver/obs` plus the phone's track as `wardriver/track`; without it a broker gets the `packets` format below. `mqttUrl` stays the first one. `id` is the key a broker's progress is stored under, so keep it stable; it defaults to the host. A broker the phone has not published to before receives what is heard from then on. |
| `brokerPresets` | no | Public brokers the add form offers as a starting point, so a hunter does not have to type them in: an array of `{ key, name, url, auth, format, label }`. `key` is required and must be unique. `auth` defaults to `companion`, `format` to `wardrive`, and a preset without a `label` publishes on `hunter`. For DutchMeshCore, list each collector twice, with `label: "hunter"` for hunts and `label: "wardriver"` for coverage drives, and never `test`, which is its sandbox. A phone takes one label per collector. Presets carry no credential. |
| `resolvers` | no | Array of `{ label, sf, url }` regional CoreScope name-resolver endpoints (back-compat: a single `resolveUrl` string also works) |
| `rssiCalibrationOffset` | no | dBm offset added to every raw RSSI before band assignment (default: 0) |

`config.json` is gitignored; never commit credentials.

A hunter can add brokers of their own and switch any broker off, under Settings, MQTT brokers. Those
choices are kept on the phone (`localStorage`), password included, and never leave it. A broker that
is switched back on receives what is heard from then on, not what it missed while it was off.

### What gets captured

A reception is stored when the phone has a fix good enough to place it. That is the only condition
(#274): once a reception is binned into the hex grid there is no way to un-see it, so a poor fix is
refused at the source rather than filtered downstream.

Being able to name the sender is **not** a condition. Two kinds carry no sender at all: a TRACE
packet (its path bytes are SNR values, not hop hashes) and a relayed packet on a DIRECT route. A
FLOOD packet whose last path hash is a single byte carries only that byte, as a `path_hash` sender
(#522). One byte is 1-in-256 and no identity on its own, so it names a node only by reach: exactly
one registry node with that prefix within reach of where it was heard (#661, AGENTS.md §7). Those
receptions are real: our own radio measured an RSSI, an SNR and a position for each. Only the
identity on top is missing or uncertain, and that identity is the part MeshCore never authenticated
anyway. Refusing them would keep the forgeable half and throw away the unforgeable one, and the map
would go quiet while the radio was hearing something.

A record without a sender carries a `packet_type` only, so the packet-type filter chips are what
show and hide it. It can never be selected as a target and never resolves to a name. Locate treats it like
any other point in the filtered set, which is the point: a transmitter you cannot name is still one
you can drive toward.

Adverts are the one thing that is refused on identity grounds: an Advert whose Ed25519 signature does
not verify is dropped, because it is the only packet whose identity is signed and the only one whose
name and self-reported position feed the registry surfaces (#356).

### Broker ACL (required)

`config.json` is served next to `index.html`, so **every visitor to the PWA can
read `mqttUsername`/`mqttPassword`** — this is unavoidable for a browser-based MQTT
publisher. The credentials are safe to expose *only* if the broker account is locked
down so a leaked credential can do nothing but publish receptions. Do not point the PWA
at a broker where this account can subscribe or publish freely.

Configure the EMQX account (`hunter-pub` in the examples) with exactly these two
authorization rules, in order:

| # | Permission | Action | Topic | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | allow | publish | `meshcore/hunter/${clientid}/packets` | publish receptions only |
| 2 | deny | all | `#` | block everything else |

Rule 2 is the catch-all: with it in place the account cannot subscribe to any topic
(no reading other clients' feeds) and cannot publish anywhere but its own packets
topic — even if EMQX's global `no_match` default is `allow`. If you run additional
broker accounts, set the broker-wide authorization default to `deny` as well.

Residual risk that no ACL can remove: because the MQTT client id is chosen by the
connecting client, anyone with the credentials can still publish fabricated receptions
(fake GPS/SNR) under any client id. That can pollute the map's data but grants no read
access and no other capability. Add server-side plausibility checks if that matters.

## The capture rule

- **`is_direct = (hops === 0)`.** Only zero-hop receptions — where the radio
  heard the transmitter directly — point at where that transmitter actually is.
  A relayed packet's SNR/RSSI describes the *last repeater*, not the target.
  Relayed traffic (hops > 0) is dropped: not logged, not published, not plotted.
- **Unattributed 0-hop packets are plotted.** A companion that never advertises
  has no pubkey on its data packets (`sender_key = null`); it is still plotted by
  signal, which is exactly how you find it. Zero-hop senders are either a full
  advert/discover pubkey or `null`.
- **Published to MQTT** on `meshcore/hunter/{rxPubkey}/packets` (QoS 1).
  Everything captured (all zero-hop receptions) is published. UI filters
  affect only the **local map view**, not what is published; the backend
  deduplicates.

## Thermal map semantics

The colour ramp runs **cold (blue) → hot (red)** for **weak (far) →
strong (close)**. Colour and heat are driven by **RSSI** using fixed dBm bands:

| Band | Range | Colour |
|---|---|---|
| Hot | >= -80 dBm | red |
| Warm | -80 to -90 dBm | orange |
| Mid | -90 to -100 dBm | yellow |
| Cool | -100 to -110 dBm | cyan |
| Cold | < -110 dBm | blue |

An optional `rssiCalibrationOffset` (dBm) in config shifts every raw RSSI
value before band assignment. SNR is still stored and shown as a number.

Two map layers are available: individual **signal points** and a **hex-heat**
aggregate layer. Toggle between them with the layer button in the map controls.

**What a lit cell claims.** Since #455 the app records every reception it can
place, not only the ones whose sender it can name, so a coloured hex cell now
answers *"something transmitted here, this strongly"* rather than *"we heard
node N here"*. That is a better claim — it is a measurement our own radio made,
and RSSI cannot be forged the way an identity can — but it is a different one,
and the coverage layer is where you meet it first. To read a cell as a
particular node, narrow to that node: select it as a target, and the layer
answers the old question again.

The same distinction runs through the points layer: a point plots where *we*
were when the transmission arrived, and only a zero-hop reception says anything
about where its originator stands. A relayed one describes the repeater that
re-broadcast it. `hops` is what separates them, and the "direct only" filter is
what narrows to the first kind.

## Ignore-list

Known stations (e.g. repeaters) that should not form false hotspots can be
muted via the **ignore-list**. Open the popup for a point and press
"Ignore this ID" to add it. Ignored stations are hidden from the map but
their receptions are still stored and published. The list is managed in the
settings sheet and persisted in localStorage.

## Name resolution

Providing multiple resolvers (e.g. one per region/spreading-factor) allows
coverage across different network segments. Every resolver whose `sf` matches
the companion's own spreading factor is asked at once: the SF is read from the
`PACKET_SELF_INFO` reply (byte 56, firmware-confirmed, see AGENTS.md §7), and
all resolvers are asked when it is unavailable or nothing matches. A name is
used only when the resolvers that know the id agree on it; two different names,
even ones that differ only in letter case, give no name. Config order decides
only which agreeing resolver supplies the node's position: the first that has
one. See `docs/2026-09-05-names-agree-or-nothing.md`. The resolver region label
is not shown next to the resolved name.

## Resilience

Receptions are written to IndexedDB before any MQTT publish attempt. The map
renders from that local store on every tick. If BLE drops, MQTT drops, or
the browser is closed and reopened, the map reloads from the stored data.

The MQTT drain loop publishes rows to the broker but **never deletes local
rows**. The local IndexedDB is the working set; the backend deduplicates by
`(origin_id, rx_at, sender_key)`.

## sender_role

`sender_role` is plumbed end-to-end through the capture record, the MQTT
payload, and the ingestor schema, but it is always `null` in the current
build. Advert-role decoding is deferred until the byte layout can be
confirmed from MeshCore firmware source. The field will never contain a
guessed value.

## Position disclaimer

Position is inferred from **radio measurements** (RSSI, SNR) via
direct reception, not from GPS tracking of the target node. The GPS coordinates
stored with each reception are the **hunter phone's own position** at the
moment of reception. The map shows where *you* were when you heard the
target, and how well — not where the target is.
