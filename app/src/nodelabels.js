// Where the node-position layer's name labels may be drawn (#425).
//
// Its own module rather than more of nodelayer.js, because it answers a
// different question. nodelayer.js works in geography — which registry rows can
// be plotted, which receptions may attribute to them, how far the estimate sits
// from the advertised point. This works in screen space, where the only inputs
// are pixels and the answer changes with the zoom without a single node
// changing. This IS the app's verbatim copy of web/nodelabels.js (#539) —
// neither deploy path can ship a file outside its own directory (#238), so
// the copies stay and web/parity.test.js pins them.
//
// Every advertised node was drawn as a divIcon with its name baked in, at full
// length, whatever the zoom and whatever else was nearby. Leaflet was told the
// marker is 14x16 — that describes the ▲, not the label — so it had no idea how
// wide these things really are, and at any real cluster density the names
// printed over each other into an unreadable smear.
//
// The rule is greedy and order-driven: walk the list once, keep a label if its
// box is clear of the ones already kept, otherwise drop it. The ▲ always stays,
// and the name is still in the popup, so nothing becomes unreachable.
//
// Widths are measured, not estimated. A first pass used an average glyph
// advance to avoid a layout pass per label per redraw; the saving was real but
// the average was not safe, since it ran narrow on uppercase names and narrow
// is the direction that permits an overlap. Measuring once per distinct name
// and caching costs the same order of work — a viewport holds tens of names,
// not thousands — and is exact. See createLabelMeasurer.
//
// Ordering is the caller's job and matters: it decides which of two colliding
// names survives. map.js sorts by node id rather than by anything positional,
// so panning the map does not reshuffle the winners and make labels flicker in
// and out of existence around the edges.

// Fallback glyph advance, for a caller with no DOM to measure in (the unit
// tests). It is an average and cannot be safe for every name: measured against
// the real .np-label, `NL-DR-GTN-OBS01` is 100.1 px against 93.0 estimated and
// `ON8AR` is 37.1 against 31.0, while `nl-dr-gtn-rp02` is 69.3 against 86.8.
// Uppercase names run narrow, which is the dangerous direction — an
// under-estimate permits the overlap this module exists to prevent — and
// MeshCore repeater names are overwhelmingly uppercase. So a real caller passes
// `measure` (see createLabelMeasurer) and this is never consulted.

//
// A label's width does not depend on the zoom — only its position does — so
// this is one forced layout per DISTINCT name, not one per label per redraw. A
// viewport holds tens of distinct names and they repeat across every pan and
// zoom, so after the first draw it is a Map lookup.
//
// `host` matters, and it is not document.body. Neither .np-label nor the probe
// sets a font-family, so both inherit, and the labels live inside the Leaflet
// container — which Leaflet's own stylesheet gives `"Helvetica Neue", Arial,
// Helvetica, sans-serif`, not the page's system-ui. Measured side by side, a
// probe on document.body reads 103.2 px for `NL-DR-GTN-OBS01` where the drawn
// label is 100.1, and 77.9 for `nl-dr-gtn-rp02` where it is 69.3 — wrong in
// both directions. Hosted in the map container, all seven names measured
// matched the drawn label exactly. So the probe goes where the labels go.
//
// The probe does NOT wear .np-label: everything that decides its width is
// shared with .np-label in the stylesheet, but a probe answering a
// `.np-label` query would be counted as a name on screen.
