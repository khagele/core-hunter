// What the HUD says about receptions that have not reached the map yet (#454).
//
// The MQTT dot answers "is the socket open". That is not the same question as
// "are my receptions getting through", and on 2026-08-24 the difference was a
// whole hunt: the app captured 3,078 receptions and the median one reached the
// server 97 minutes later, with nothing at all sent for the first 71. The dot
// was lit throughout. A hunter driving a search pattern was working from a map
// an hour and a half stale and had no way to tell.
//
// So the backlog gets a number. Pure decision here, DOM in app.js.

// Below this a backlog is just the drain doing its job between 5 s ticks --
// a burst of receptions is queued and gone again before anyone could read it.
// Showing "3 queued" every few seconds would train people to ignore the line
// that matters.
export const BACKLOG_NOTICE_MIN = 25

// Above this the backlog is not a hiccup: at the drain's batch of 100 per pass
// it is minutes of catching up, and on a hunt that is the map lying to you.
export const BACKLOG_ALARM = 250

export function backlogState(pending, { connected = true } = {}) {
  const n = Number.isFinite(pending) ? Math.max(0, Math.trunc(pending)) : 0
  // Disconnected with nothing waiting is not worth a line: the drain has
  // nothing to do either way.
